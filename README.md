## What is Atrial Fibrilation
Atrial fibrilation (AFib) is one of the most common cardiac arrhythmias, affecting more than $200,000$ people in the United States each year. AFib is characterized by rapid, irregular heartbeats, where the atria of the heart beat out of coordination with the ventricles. Even though AFib is not dangerous by itself, the uncoordinate rhythm increases the risk of blood clotting and stroke.
